# Surprise Attack

One warband is out searching the ruins of Mordheim for loot when it is attacked by an enemy warband. The defenders are spread thinly and must muster a defence quickly to drive off their attackers.

## Terrain

Starting with the attacker, each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.

## Set-up

1. The defending player rolls a D6 for each Hero and Henchman group in his warband, in any order he chooses. On a 1-3, they are elsewhere in the ruins and turn up later as reinforcements. On a 4-6 they are deployed at the start of the game. Note that at least one Hero or Henchmen group will be present at the start. If all roll 1-3, the last Hero or Henchmen group will automatically be deployed at the start of the battle.

2. The defender deploys his available Heroes and Henchmen on the table. No model may be closer than 8" to another model, as the warband is spread out wide to search the ruins. No model may be deployed closer than 8" to a table edge.

3. The attacker deploys his whole warband within 8" of a random table edge, as shown below. He may choose which edge to nominate as '1' before rolling to see where he deploys.

## Starting the Game

The attacker always gets the first turn.

## Special Rules

The defender, at the start of his second and subsequent turns, may roll a D6 for each of his Henchmen groups or Heroes not yet on the table. On a 4+ they move on in the movement phase from a random table edge as shown below – roll a D6. All reinforcements for that turn arrive from the same edge and may charge on the turn in which they arrive.

## Ending the Game

The game ends when one warband fails a Rout test. The routing warband loses.

## Experience

**+1 Survives.** If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the battle they gain +1 Experience.

**+1 Winning Leader.** The leader of the winning warband gains +1 Experience.

**+1 Per Enemy Out of Action.** A Hero earns +1 Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
