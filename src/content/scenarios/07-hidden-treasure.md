# Hidden Treasure

There is a rumour that one of the ruined buildings has a concealed cellar with a treasure chest hidden in it. Two rival warbands have heard about the cellar and are now searching the area. Who knows what they will find?

## Terrain

Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.

## Set-up

Both players roll a D6 and whoever rolls highest chooses which warband sets up first. This warband is deployed within 8" of any table edge the player chooses. His opponent sets up within 8" of the opposite side.

## Special Rules

All the warriors (not animals!) in each warband know roughly what they are looking for and must inspect the buildings to find the treasure. Each time a warrior enters a building which has not been previously searched by either side roll 2D6. On a score of 12, he has found the treasure. Buildings in the deployment zones are not searched (since they have already been thoroughly ransacked) and each building may only be searched once.

If you have not scored 12 with any roll when there is only one building left to search, the treasure will automatically be found there. After finding the treasure chest, the warrior must then take it to safety via his own table edge. Carrying the treasure chest will slow the warrior carrying it to half speed. Two or more models may carry the chest without any penalty. You may use the treasure chest model to represent the chest. If the carrier is put out of action, place the treasure chest at the spot where he fell. Any man-sized model may pick it up by moving into base contact with it.

Whoever recovers the chest may roll on the following chart after the game to see what the chest contains. Note that you roll for each item separately, apart from the gold crowns, which are always automatically found. For example, roll to see if you find any wyrdstone – you need a 5+ to find it. Then roll to see if you find the armour, and so on. This can make the chest a very valuable acquisition – however, it could also mean that your warband has risked death for only three gold crowns!

### Treasure Chest Contents

| Items | D6 Roll Required to Find |
|-------|--------------------------|
| 3D6 gc | Automatic |
| D3 pieces of wyrdstone | 5+ |
| Suit of light armour | 4+ |
| Sword | 3+ |
| D3 gems worth 10 gc each | 5+ |

## Starting the Game

Roll a D6. The player rolling highest has the first turn.

## Ending the Game

When one warband gets the treasure to safety, or a warband fails a Rout test, the game ends. The victorious warband then gains the treasure chest.
