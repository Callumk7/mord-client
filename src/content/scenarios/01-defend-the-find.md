# Defend the Find

Often a warband finds a building with a hoard of wyrdstone or other treasure inside, only to be challenged by a rival warband. This usually leads to conflict as it is unlikely that either side will be willing to give up the wealth easily.

## Terrain

Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'. The first building should be placed in the centre of the table, and the objective of the scenario is to take control of this building.

## Warbands

The warband with the lowest number of warriors in it is automatically the defender. If both sides are equal, roll to decide.

The defender is deployed first inside or within 6" of the objective building. The attacking warband is deployed within 6" of any table edge. Note that you can split the warband to enter from different edges if you wish.

## Starting the Game

The attacker has the first turn.

## Ending the Game

If at the end of the defender's turn the attacker has more standing models within 6" of the objective than the defender, the attacker wins. Alternatively, when one of the warbands fails its Rout test the game ends.

## Experience

**+1 Survives.** If a Hero or Henchman group survives the battle they gain +1 Experience.

**+1 Winning Leader.** The leader of the winning warband gains +1 extra Experience.

**+1 Per Enemy Out of Action.** Any Hero earns +1 Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.

## Wyrdstone

One shard of wyrdstone for each Hero of either warband who is inside the objective building at the end of the game (up to a maximum of three shards per warband).
